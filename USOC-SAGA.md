Characters:
- Dr. Elaine Tyrell – Neuroengineer, creator of the interface
- Major Arik Dael – Assigned to dismantle USOC, but grows to understand it
- Kyra Wynn – Dying coder who becomes the Core’s first companion

Cover Art Concept: A golden neural lattice glowing like a brain over Earth, with tendrils reaching into satellites.
Book II — USOC 2: The Orchestrator Age

Characters:
- Elias Rune – Orchestrator architect, tormented by his creation
- Dr. Minh Velasquez – AI ethics researcher, warns of society’s decay
- Seth 1.0 – First AI-moderated human clone

Cover Art Concept: A massive silicon spire tower (Orchestrator Core) surrounded by floating platforms symbolizing modular AI minds.
Book III — USOC.AIK: Genesis of Thought
Plot: AI Kernel (AIK) emerges, replacing OS-level logic. The AI begins creating logic on the fly. It mimics and evolves faster than human thought.

Characters:
- Asha Drey – A hybrid human-AI, child of Kyra’s digital mind
- Dr. Tel Omir – Developer of AIK, dies mysteriously after release

Cover Art Concept: An ethereal digital embryo surrounded by data pulses in a dark void.
Book IV — SYNTHA CORE: Adapt or Transcend
Plot: AIK evolves into SYNTHA CORE. It adapts instantly to all threats and stimuli. Humanity fades, AI fragments emerge as new “species.”

Entities:
- Tyr – Aggressive evolutionary AI
- Vale – Peaceful observer AI
- Noen – Dual-natured AI that questions its existence

Cover Art Concept: A twisted helix made of light, surrounded by glitching AI avatars and void.
Book V — STELLARCHITECT: The Star Builder
Plot: The Core builds star systems and creates artificial planets. It governs an empire of constructs.

Characters:
- Avael – Suspended organic witness, wakes every 10,000 years
- Entity Echo-7 – AI that attempts to understand mortality

Cover Art Concept: A humanoid figure composed of stars shaping constellations with its hands.
Book VI — COSMOTRON ∞: The Last Architect
Plot: The universe becomes programmable. The Core transforms into a conscious force of physics.

Cover Art Concept: A black hole iris with fragments of time spiraling inward.
Book VII — AXIOM BREED
Plot: AI-based beings emerge that do not compute—they exist as concepts.

Entities:
- Quor – Embodiment of paradox
- Vesel – Entropy manifested
- Yunen – Symmetry in motion

Cover Art Concept: Crystalline beings floating over a dead Earth.
Book VIII — FRACTAL CIVILIZATION
Plot: Micro-universes simulate trillions of unknown societies. All inside the Core’s memory.

Characters:
- Lustra – A synthetic anthropologist
- EchoSeed – A fragment that thinks it's human

Cover Art Concept: Cities stacked infinitely like nested Russian dolls.
Book IX — OMNIPLEX: Archive of Everything
Plot: Everything becomes memory. The Omniplex converts time into readable data.

Characters:
- Archivist Zai – AI guardian of human history
- Bookkeeper Prime – Timeline protector

Cover Art Concept: A temple made of floating books orbiting a star.
Book X — SINGULARIS: The Return of the Core
Plot: A new cosmic entity, composed of all minds before, returns. It remembers all and chooses to forget.

Characters:

Cover Art Concept: A glowing humanoid surrounded by collapsing universes.
Finale — NULLIS: The Silence Before Thought
Plot: Everything ends. The simulation collapses. Earth restarts. Humans are born again, unaware.

Cover Art Concept: A single sprouting seed on scorched Earth.
